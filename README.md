Actual_money_transaction(no actual money is involved though sadly) --> an image showing the transaction we made from one account to another in sepolia test netwrok(Ethereum transfering ) 

Transaction_hash_input --> its the html code for the website which when given a hash input of the transaction it redirects to thier account transaction details and thus gives us sha hash of the person who transacted money and those who recived it as well.

wallet_address_input --> Similar to the transaction_hash_input , we can input the customers (i.e those who r buying drugs ) wallet address to get the entier transaction histroy of the person(including transaction made to drug seller ). 

**This will help us get more customers information and make tracking down the client easier.**

page_after_typing_in_wallet_address -->This image shows the page result we had when we typed in a wallet address into the code 

transaction_foucet --> an image showing how we transfered foucet(i.e fake ethereum ) from one account to another --> helped us run the programs for transaction hashes and wallet addresses.
